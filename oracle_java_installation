# Download a '.tar.gz' oracle java from the oracle's site
# Extract it
# Move the extracted folder to '/usr/lib/jvm'. 
# This is not required but it's the place where java runtime is installed and IDE's look in this folder.

sudo mv /path_to_jdk/jdk1.x.x /usr/lib/jvm/

# Before adding this jdk as an alternatives, you can see that the new alternatives is not listed.

sudo update-alternatives --query java
sudo update-alternatives --query javac 

# Next, add the new jdk alternatives (U can give any number).

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/jre/bin/java 2000
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin/javac 2000

# Now you should see the new jdk listed and you can switch between the alternatives with this command:

sudo update-alternatives --config java
sudo update-alternatives --config javac

Create a file /etc/profile.d/oraclejdk.sh with the following content (adapt the paths to reflect the path where you stored your JDK):

export J2SDKDIR=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.x.x
export J2REDIR=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.x.x/jre
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.x.x/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.x.x/db/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.x.x/jre/bin
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.x.x
export DERBY_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.x.x/db

# Save the file and then run the script using:

source /etc/profile.d/oraclejdk.sh
